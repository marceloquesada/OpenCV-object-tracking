    ''' MIL Tracker: Better accuracy than BOOSTING tracker but does a poor job of reporting failure. (minimum OpenCV 3.0.0)
    KCF Tracker: Kernelized Correlation Filters. Faster than BOOSTING and MIL. Similar to MIL and KCF, does not handle full occlusion well. (minimum OpenCV 3.1.0)
    CSRT Tracker: Discriminative Correlation Filter (with Channel and Spatial Reliability). Tends to be more accurate than KCF but slightly slower. (minimum OpenCV 3.4.2)
    MedianFlow Tracker: Does a nice job reporting failures; however, if there is too large of a jump in motion, such as fast moving objects, or objects that change quickly in their appearance, the model will fail. (minimum OpenCV 3.0.0)
    TLD Tracker: Iâ€™m not sure if there is a problem with the OpenCV implementation of the TLD tracker or the actual algorithm itself, but the TLD tracker was incredibly prone to false-positives. I do not recommend using this OpenCV object tracker. (minimum OpenCV 3.0.0)
    MOSSE Tracker: Very, very fast. Not as accurate as CSRT or KCF but a good choice if you need pure speed. (minimum OpenCV 3.4.1)
    GOTURN Tracker: The only deep learning-based object detector included in OpenCV. It requires additional model files to run. My initial experiments showed it was a bit of a pain to use even though it reportedly handles viewing changes well. (minimum OpenCV 3.2.0) '''
